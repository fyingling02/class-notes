- There are two security systems for sharing files
    - NTFS Permission (security tab)
    - Sharing permissions (sharing tab)


    - Because there are 2 security systems
        - sharing permissions only affects when people navigate in to the file over the share
        - NFTFS permissions alway apply

    - Permissions can be inherited, but can be disabled

    - if there are two conflicting perms - the stricter one tends to win

    - perms allow  ALLOW or DENY - dont use deny unless necessaracy, it's bad pratice
